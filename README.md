## What is it?

CodeJot is a platform for programmers (and everyone)
to jot down ideas and plans and other stuff.

## Why use it?

I really don't have a clue just use whatever.

## Why did I build this?

I wanted a note taking app to write down notes.
I am aware there are other (better) note taking sites
that offer WAY more functionality and tools but I also
wanted to practice my web development skills and I wanted
my data to be safe even though it probably safe on other
sites too.

(just excuses)
